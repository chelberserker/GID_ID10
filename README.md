# GID_ID10

This is code for the processing of Surface X-ray Scattering data, obtained on the ID10 beamline at ESRF.

## Content:
1) GID class, used for the data analysis of Grazing Incidence Diffraction data obtained with linear detector and Soller collimator
2) rebin function, used for rebinning data, from XRR_ID10_ESRF

## Functionality:
1) Reading h5 files, produced at ID10-SURF
2) All necessary corrections, including: conversion to q, rebinning
3) Calculation of reciprocal space maps, obtained during GID experiment
4) Plotting and saving graphs and data
